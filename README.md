Introduction
Heart disease poses a global health challenge, necessitating early detection strategies to improve health outcomes. Our project combines data analysis with visual representations to explore the factors contributing to heart disease, aiming to enhance preventive measures and patient care.

Objectives
To investigate the relationship between various attributes (such as sex, age, mental and physical health) and heart disease risk.
To examine the impact of physical activity on heart disease risk.
To develop a machine learning model predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various attributes.
Motivations
Our motivation stems from the potential of visualizations and predictive algorithms to enhance understanding and management of heart disease, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

Methodology
We adopted a hybrid Crisp-DM & Waterfall model, encompassing goal setting, research evaluation, data mining plan development, data pre-processing, model creation and evaluation, and deployment to a GitHub repository.

Dataset Description
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains patient data from a study on heart disease, including 18 columns (age, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.) and 319,796 rows. Each row represents a patient, with the target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

Visualizations
Our project includes various visualizations to explore correlations between features and to distribute correlations among the features, aiding in the understanding and analysis of factors influencing heart disease.

Algorithms Used
Decision Tree: With an F1 Score of 0.244 and Accuracy of 0.86.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): With an F1 Score of 0.213 and Accuracy of 0.90.

Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using a split of 70:30 for training and testing, focusing on metrics like F1 score and accuracy to ensure effective prediction capabilities.

Conclusion
Our study offers significant insights into heart disease, emphasizing the importance of data quality for reliable results. Through analysis and modeling, we can identify key factors and strategies for early diagnosis and prevention, enhancing treatment and understanding of heart disease.
